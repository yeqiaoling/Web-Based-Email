# Web-based Email System Design

I deployed [a web-based email system](https://yeqiaoling.shinyapps.io/singurity_take_home_2/). It ables sign up, sign in, log off and retrieve username/password functionalities.

*  [design flow](https://github.com/yeqiaoling/Web-Based-Email/blob/master/flow.pdf): a chart showing interactions between client and server sides
